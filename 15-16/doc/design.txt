map
===

* the map is a triangular grid
* the ground-level triangles are equiliteral in world space
* the viewing angle is chosen such that ground-level triangles become isosceles right triangles in
  view space

	# world space triangle height
	h_i = sqrt(3) / 2
	
	# view space triangle height
	h_o = ½
	
	h_i * cos(a) = h_o
	cos(a) = h_o / h_i
	a = acos(h_o / h_i)
	a = acos(½ / (sqrt(3) / 2))
	
	# viewing angle
	a = acos(1 / sqrt(3))

* each map vertex is assigned a discrete height value between 0 and 255 that is scaled with 1/3 in
  world space
* two adjacent vertices should not differ in height more than 1 unit
* each map vertex is assigned a terrain type
